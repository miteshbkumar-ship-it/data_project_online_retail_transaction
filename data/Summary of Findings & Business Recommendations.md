### **Overall Conclusion:**

This analysis reveals a classic retail pattern following the Pareto Principle, where a small portion of products drive the majority of revenue. The business has significant opportunities in three key areas:

1\. Product Streamlining: With only 8% of products generating 80% of revenue, there's massive potential to optimize the product catalog. Focusing resources on the 328 high-performing products and eliminating dead inventory will improve profitability and operational efficiency.

2\. Customer Lifetime Value: With 41% of customers making only one purchase, implementing targeted retention strategies could dramatically increase customer lifetime value and reduce acquisition costs.

3\. International Growth: The UK market represents 82.7% of revenue, but proven international markets (Netherlands, Germany, France) show strong engagement. Strategic expansion in these markets offers growth potential with lower risk
